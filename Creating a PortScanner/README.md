# Description

Picture a bay where lots of private boats are docked. The location is called a seaport, literally a port at or on the sea. Everyone wanting to dock there, requesting landing services uses the same port. Seaports work with berth numbers assigned to individual boats. The port name and the berth number combine into the “who, what, and where” of boat identification.

The concept of ip address and port is similar. Here the sea_port_name is similar to the IP address while the latter matches with the network_port_no.

Ports are numbered for consistency and programming. The most commonly used and best known ports are those numbered 0 to 1023 dedicated for Internet use, but they can extend far higher for specialized purposes. Each port set or range is assigned specialized jobs or functions, and that’s generally all they do. Usually, all identical system services or functions use the same port numbers on the receiving servers and they remain consistent what-so-ever may be the situation.

When a criminal targets a house for a burglary, typically the first thing he or she checks is if there is an open window or door through which access to the home can be gained. Security technicians often use devices/softwares, known as port-scanners, that enable them to scan all the ports to audit computers for vulnerabilities. Any time there are open ports on one’s personal computer, there is potential for the loss of data, the occurrence of a virus, and at times, even complete system compromise.

Developing a port-scanner is not so difficult as it may seem. The end result of the scanner will be as follows:
`INPUT : IPv4 address, Port Range
FUNCTION : Enter an IP address and a port range
           where the program will then attempt to
           find open ports on the given computer
           by connecting to each of them. On any
           successful connection ports, mark the
           port as open.
OUTPUT : Status of port (open/closed)`
